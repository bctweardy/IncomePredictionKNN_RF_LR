    "The dataset for analysis originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data from the 1994 Census database and was originally extracted by Barry Becker. These data contain 48,842 observations and 14 attributes seperated in two distinct datsets, training and testing. Becker extracted the census data based on meeting all of the following four conditions:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. AAGE > 16\n",
    "        2. AGI > 100\n",
    "        3. AFNLWGT > 1\n",
    "        4. HRSWK > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, these data are split by Becker into train-test datasets using MLC++ GenCVFiles (2/3, 1/3 random).\n",
    "\n",
    "48,842 instances, mix of continuous and discrete    (train=32,561, test=16,281)\n",
    "\n",
    "45,222 of instances with unknown values are removed (train=30,162, test=15,060)\n",
    "\n",
    "train = adult.data AND test = adult.test\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names\n",
    "\n",
    "The original task for gathering this dataset and what will be analyzed throughout this semester's project is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year in annual salary.  The attribte salary_range designates the annual salary via a binary classification of: >50K or <=50K.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to use the classification prediction method of taking the collection of records (adult.data) as the training set, whereas salary_range is the class.  We will develop a model which aims to predict the class, salary_range, as a function of the other attributes.  Ultimately, our goal is take the test data, adult.test, and predict the class, salary_range, as accurately as possible.  Therefore, below we are preprocessing the training dataset, adult.data, containing the 32,561 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conducting an analysis on this data, there are many reasons why an organization would benefit from it. One in particular could be from a marketing standpoint. Businesses invest a large portion of there expenditures toward their marketing department to make sure that they market their products toward the correct demographics. For example, marketing the latest and greatest BMW to a demographic of individuals that make less than $50k annually is probably not a smart business decision and would undoubtedly fail. The financial cost of this mistake could potentially cost a company millions of dollars. The benefit a company has to understanding their customer base can truly be a profitable advantage. The factors in this model could be used by an organization to manage their marketing activity by developing and advertising products to meet the needs of their specific customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to market a BMW to a certain demographic by email, you do not mind if you have false positives. We want to email all people that our data say is a positive even if it may be wrong. We are ok sending it out to a false positive in order to get the email out to the correct demographic since this is a cheap way of advertising. This is considered high recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if you were to hold a car show and cover travel and lodging expenses as well as \"wine and dine\" the customer, you would not want to miss your target demographic and invite the wrong demographics. It is much more expensive to advertise to the wrong group. Therefore, we are okay with not sending the invite to people because we have them classified wrong. This would be considered high precision because everyone that is invited will have been classified correctly even if we miss some.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know this example might be considered an extreme, but we are focusing this project on the scenario of sending out an email advertising campaign.  As such we are focusing on high accuracy so that we get the highest guarantee that the customers we are targetting are in the class of making more than $50K.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that a typical BMW customer has a higher level of education. For this reason, the second task that we have chosen to predict is education level based on the other variables. Again, with the email campaign we want a high accuracy in the demographics that receive the email. Therefore, we are looking for high accuracy in this task as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In predicting both tasks, we will use K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the extra work, we have performed a grid search for the K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest models in both tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for both tasks we used ten fold cross validation because we believe the data is not biased toward one class. Therefore, ten fold cross validation would sufficiently divide the data. "

    "The most important attribute from the logistic regression model is 'capital_gain' followed by 'marital_status_Married-civ-spouse', 'education_num', 'age', and 'hours_per_week' in predicting whether income is greater than \\$50K per year or if it is equal to or less than \\$50K per year. This is illustrated by the bar graph below. People with a salary of greater than $50K can be assumed to have higher capital gains. It is also more typical for one to increase income as they get old and have more education which is why it makes sense that age and education_num also are part of the model. Marriage tends to create typically create more stability, therefore, one would expect a better earning potential. They will be more career-focused. Lastly, hard work usually pays off, so higher hours worked per week should create a higher earning potential."

This could be of use in a business setting because it may be important for a business to understand the education level of the demographics of the target customer base. Unfortunately, getting it correct only 30% of the time is not very accurate and can result in many errors costing a business a lot of money in marketing products to the wrong demographic. For this dataset, KNN may not be the best algorithm to be using when predicting the education class of an individual."
